# Advanced CS Maze Lab

This lab uses three different algorithms to traverse a customizeable maze:
- Breadth first search, using queues
- Depth first search, using stacks
- Recursion

It uses Java swing (outdated but effective :D) to render the GUI. You can change walls, customize the size of the maze, and edit the starting and ending points. Currently working on a slider to change the speed of the program's "progression" through the maze to make it more visible. There are instructions to running this program in the "Info" button if you decide to try it out yourself and download the project somehow.
